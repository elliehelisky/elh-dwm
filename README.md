My DWM Build
Compiled on Void Linux

# Build Dependencies

# Optional
By default, I am using ST, rofi, spectacle, and nemo.  If you do not wish to use any of these, you can edit config.def.h to replace st with a terminal of your choice, rofi with dmenu, etc.

To install, clone this repository, navigate to the folder and run sudo make clean install.
